TL;DR
I'm currently working as a software engineer at a small traditional company. Our technology stack is quite outdated, and most of the time is spent developing Windows desktop software using Microsoft Foundational Classes. The majority of our tickets are related to MFC, and we donâ€™t have a traditional backend. Since joining the company, Iâ€™ve introduced concepts like CI/CD and unit testing, and have been working on decoupling our previous code, as all the logic processing is integrated into this front-end solution. Itâ€™s common to have a function that spans a thousand lines. Recently, our embedded system needs to be migrated from Windows OS to Linux OS, which I find relatively interesting. But overall, working here is very frustrating and not helpful for my career development. What should I do now?
A bit more background: I received my master's degree in 2022, and in September 2022, I received an L4 offer from Amazon after an afternoon of interviews(experienced portal). Unfortunately, my offer was withdrawn in the November layoffs. I am grateful to my current employer for hiring me when I was in need of money, otherwise, I might have had to consider pursuing a PhD degree (I am an international student).
At the beginning of 2024, I started job hunting again. I interviewed for an L5 position at AWS, including system design, algorithms, and OOD. Algorithms are no problem for me, I can even solve those problems 15 minutes earlier, and I communicated well with the manager about system design. However, one interviewer consistently tried to find faults with my OOD solutions. Despite writing the code, I felt he did not want me on his team, and I ultimately did not pass the interview. I have one year of full-time work experience in another country, related to the internet, and for me, programming languages are not an issue. I am also learning distributed system design and have practical experience, but I keep receiving rejection letters. Iâ€™m surprised I keep getting interviews with Amazon, and except for that one interviewer, my interview experiences have been very good, and I believe my skills are not bad.
What should I do now? I don't want to start living a retired life while I'm still so young; I'm seeking more complex, hands-on experience. It seems hard to achieve this individually with a mature product, in a distributed environment, tackling real-world problems...
I don't care about the salary. What matters to me is if they sponsor visa, and if it's in the internet business, thatâ€™s enough. Location doesnâ€™t matter to me either.
If anyone has ideas or suggestions, please leave a comment. Iâ€™m increasingly feeling like Iâ€™m getting older.

Thank you for reading.
